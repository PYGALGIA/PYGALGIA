Call me Mar, Uki or Pygalgia, anything else is fine though! 

I'm mostly idle in PT, just sort of grinding playtime but I don't mind interacting as well! Though, please interact first through a whisper, and expect some awkwardness
since I'm never the type to socialize. Cuddling or hiding is completely fine as well <3

I'm a big fan of certain Roblox myths, such as Cult Family, Smiles Family and myth era Days Union which is my personal favorite (I don't like the new lore nor the admins
at all.) As much as I like the two, I'm way more hyperfixated on DU! ((this is for the du fans/skins in pt; i really love ur du skins but im too much of a coward to whip out a
crown lmao,. It may not seem like it but I dead ass wanted to friend/int with u))

I'm also an artist, so I'm most likely drawing while I idle in PT so forgive me if I see your whisper too late!
